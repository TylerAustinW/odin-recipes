    <h2>About the Dish</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Pancakes</strong> are a traditional breakfast treat that are easy
      to make. They are a type of flatbread that is made from a batter and
      cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. The batter is
      made from flour, eggs, milk, and butter. Pancakes are often served with
      syrup, butter, or fruit. They can also be filled with sweet or savory
      fillings such as blueberries, chocolate chips, or cheese.
