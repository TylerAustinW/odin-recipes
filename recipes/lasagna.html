    <h2>About the Dish</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Lasagna</strong> is a type of wide, flat pasta,
      <strong>possibly one of the oldest types of pasta.</strong> Lasagna, or
      the singular lasagna, is also an Italian dish made of stacked layers of
      this flat pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù and other
      vegetables, cheese, and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and
      basil. The dish may be topped with melted grated mozzarella cheese.
      Typically, the cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and
      then baked in an oven. The resulting lasagna casserole is cut into
      single-serving square portions.

    <h2>How to make American Lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over high heat, add in the oil and cook the ground
        beef until it is golden. This should take around 5-8 minutes. Drain away
        the fat from the beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the oregano, basil, 1 ½ tsp salt, brown sugar, tomato paste, and
        diced tomatoes in the beef and keep simmering for another 40-45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees C.</li>
      <li>Boil water in a large pot and a pinch of salt in it.</li>
      <li>
        When the water reaches a boil, add the pasta sheets and cook them for
        5-8 minutes or until they are al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the water and blot the pasta sheets with some napkins until they
        are dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, beat the eggs, parsley, ½ tsp salt, parmesan, and
        ricotta cheese and mix well until all the flavors are fully combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a 9x13 inch baking dish, grease the bottom with some cooking spray or
        butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the dish with 1/3 of the pasta sheets until it is fully covered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pasta sheets with 1/3 ricotta cheese mixture, top it again
        with 1/3 of the grated mozzarella, and then 1/3 of the beef tomato
        mixture. Repeat this layering technique thrice and sprinkle some
        additional mozzarella and parmesan on the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes and let it stand for 10-15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
